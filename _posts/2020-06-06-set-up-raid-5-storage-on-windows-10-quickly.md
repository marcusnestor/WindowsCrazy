<strong><strong><strong><span class="dcap">H</span><strong>ow to set up RAID 5 storage on Windows 10?</strong></strong></strong></strong> It is used to combine <strong>multiple drives</strong> to create larger logical storage using a <strong>RAID 5 configuration</strong> to improve performance and protect your files from a <strong>single drive failure.</strong> The abbreviation of <strong>RAID</strong> is Redundant Array of Independent Disks. When it turns to failure, you can replace the drive, and the data will be created again from the data on the other drives.

In this article, we give a piece of brief information on<strong> how to</strong> <strong>set up RAID 5 storage on Windows 10</strong> in easy steps.

 	<li>Then in the <strong>Resiliency section,</strong> click the drop-down arrow of Resiliency type and select the <strong>Parity</strong> option, which is similar to the RAID 5 level.</li>
 	<li>In the <strong>Size section</strong>, set out the maximum size as needed, you need to change the size option carefully, because a pool can be larger than the actual physical capacity, and if you run out of space, you’ll need to add more drives.</li>
