<span class="dcap">5</span><strong>400 RPM vs 7200 RPM</strong>: It is vital to understand the differences between 5400 RPM and 7200 RPM if you are planning to upgrade your system or buying a new device. The advancements in technology lead to the creation of new Solid State Drives (SSD) that comes with its good speed and performance. But, most of the users will prefer traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDD) when it comes to storage.

The areal density of today's hard drives is enhancing and head movement is faster because the distance to data points is shorter. So, let's look out the keypoints of <strong>5400 RPM vs 7200 RPM</strong> that offer you a good clarification about its performance.
<h2 id="1">5400 RPM vs 7200 RPM:</h2>
At the present time, the speed of hard drives can be as high as 15,000 RPM. In servers, high-speed disks like 10,000 RPM are used. The hard drives with the rotation speed 5400 RPM or 7200 RPM are generally used for home use.
<h3>5400 RPM:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The advantages of 5400 RPM are low noise, low energy consumption, longer lifespan, low heat production and less expensive.</li>
 	<li>The high rotation speed of disks can lessen the average rotation latency time and read and write time of the hard drive. It may bring negative effects that include increased noise, temperature increase, etc.</li>
 	<li>The working time of the battery will be shortened if other factors remain unchanged. It is considered to be a good option for storing large files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7200 RPM:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The major advantage of 7200 RPM is high performance. It is faster than 5400 RPM hard disks. Usually, the more the hard drive RPM, the faster the hard drive.</li>
 	<li>The rotation speed is faster than 5400 RPM hard disks.</li>
 	<li>The read and write capability of 7200 RPM is an average of 120 MB/s while for 5400 RPM is 100 MB/s speed</li>
</ul>
Therefore, from the above aspects, if you just use hard disk drives to backup data or store files, 5400 RPM hard disks are enough capable of that. If you are looking for high-performance hard drives, then you have to go with the 7200 RPM hard disk drives.
