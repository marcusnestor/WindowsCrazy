<span class="dcap">C</span><strong>lear Clipboard in Windows 10</strong>: <strong>Clipboard</strong> is a temporary storage place where every copied or cut items (including text, images, and other information) will be stored until you log off or restart your computer. You can view and access the items in clipboard history through a shortcut <strong>Windows Key + V</strong>. So, you can paste the items somewhere else from the clipboard. It is also possible to pin items that you may use frequently.

If you have enabled the option of saving multiple items in the clipboard, all your copy or cut actions will be saved in the clipboard. If not so, then only one copy or cut action will be saved, the earlier item gets replaced with the new one.

The <strong>items stored in the clipboard remain accessible</strong>, even after you have executed the paste command. If you are using a public computer and if you have a habit of copying and pasting passwords, then it may turn out a <strong>security risk</strong> as your information can be accessed by others.
