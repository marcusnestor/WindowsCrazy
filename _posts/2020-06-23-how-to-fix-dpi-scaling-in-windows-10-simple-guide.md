<span class="dcap">F</span><strong>ix DPI Scaling in Windows 10</strong>: High-resolution displays are great but when they are packed into the smaller displays, the items on the screen may become small or blurry and so it is hard to see the use. This sort of display scaling is an issue especially when you are using multi-monitor setups and desktop apps.

Windows 10 brings lots of modifications to fix the blurry applications and it leads to incorrect scaling. Now, you can find a useful option in the Settings app to fix the blurry applications easily. In this tutorial, we will illustrate the simple steps of two methods to <strong>Fix DPI Scaling in Windows 10</strong>.
