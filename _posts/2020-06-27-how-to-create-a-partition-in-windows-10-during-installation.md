<span class="dcap">C</span><strong>reate Partition during Installation of Windows 10</strong>: If you want to keep your files and apps separate from the main installation or if you have an idea to create a dual boot system, then you have to create a custom partition for Windows 10.

This tutorial explains <strong>how to</strong> <b>create a partition in Windows 10 during installation</b>. In addition, we will illustrate how to create a partition with remaining unused space.
<h2 id="1">Quick Steps to Create a Partition during Windows 10 Installation:</h2>
<p id="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You have to change the BIOS settings in order to boot your device with an installation media. To do so, press any one of the function keys (F1, F2, F3, F10, or F12), the ESC or Delete key. It is recommended to take a backup of your files and then proceed to follow the steps.</p>

<ol>
 	<li>You have to boot your PC with a Windows 10 installation media.</li>
 	<li>To begin, you have to press any key.</li>
 	<li>Then, click the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Install now</strong> button.</li>
 	<li>Now, you have to enter the product key of Windows 10 and then click the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li>
 	<li>Choose the Windows 10 version as per your product key (if applicable).</li>
 	<li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button and then continue to select the option of '<strong>I accept the license terms</strong>'.</li>
 	<li>Then, you have to tap on the Next button and select the '<strong>Custom: Install Windows only</strong> <strong>(advanced)</strong>'option.</li>
 	<li>You have to choose each partition of the hard drive and click the <strong>Delete</strong> button. In general, 'Drive 0' includes all the installation files. You need to make sure that deleting a partition will erase all data within and there is no need to delete the partitions from a secondary hard drive.</li>
 	<li>After that, you have to choose the <strong>Drive 0 Unallocated Space </strong>and click the<strong> New </strong>button.</li>
 	<li>You have to make sure that the OS needs at least 20GB of space but, you have to create a partition between 60GB to 100GB in size in order to get rid of running out of space to install applications and future updates. So, considering the vital things for the Windows 10 installation and apps, you have to indicate the amount of space in megabytes.</li>
 	<li>Then, click the <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
 	<li>You have to choose the <strong>Drive 0 Partition 4 (Primary) </strong>and click the<strong> Next </strong>button.</li>
</ol>
After completing the above steps, Windows 10 set up will begin to install on the specified partition. Once the installation gets completed, you have to go through the OOBE (out-of-box experience) to create an account and conclude the installation.
<h2 id="2">Create a Partition with Remaining Unassigned Space:</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Go to the <strong>Start</strong> menu. In the search box, you have to type '<strong>disk management</strong>' and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.
