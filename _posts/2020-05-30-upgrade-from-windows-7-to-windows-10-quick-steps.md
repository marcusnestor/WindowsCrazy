<span class="dcap">U</span><strong>pgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10</strong>: An upgrade advances your PC from an older version of Windows such as Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Microsoft suggests using Windows 10 on a new computer to experience its new features and security enhancements. But, the upgrade can take place on your existing PC.

The upgrade process can be done using the Media Creation Tool. This tool is also available for computers running Windows 8.1 OS. Here, in this guide, we will illustrate how to <strong>Upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10</strong>.
<h2 id="1">Important Points to Consider:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure that the upgrade of Windows 7 to Windows 10 will erase your apps and settings.</li>
 	<li>You may find an option to keep your data but due to the differences between Windows 7 and Windows 10, it is not always possible to keep all of your existing applications.</li>
 	<li>Take a full back up of your files, documents, data, etc in case you need to rollback.</li>
 	<li>It is a good idea to note down what apps you are using in the current OS so you can download the installers later.</li>
 	<li>Confirm the minimum hardware requirement of your system before the upgrade.</li>
 	<li>Disconnect any hardware such as phone, printer, external hard drive, and other USB devices to get rid of issues.</li>
 	<li>It is suggested to uninstall any software that includes security software, antivirus, and any third-party applications that hinders your upgrade.</li>
